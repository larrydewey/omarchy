# Keyboard, Mouse, Trackpad

Hyprland lets you configure all your inputs in great detail. You can change the keyboard repeat to be supersonically fast or make the trackpad use natural scrolling. You change all of it in `~/.config/hypr/input.lua`, which you can also reach via _Setup > Input_ in the Omarchy menu (`Super + Space`). Anything you set there replaces Omarchy's defaults.

Here's an example:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    -- Use multiple keyboard layouts and switch between them with Left Alt + Right Alt
    kb_layout = "us,dk",
    kb_options = "compose:caps,shift:both_capslock_cancel,grp:alts_toggle",

    -- Change speed of keyboard repeat
    repeat_rate = 40,
    repeat_delay = 600,

    -- Increase sensitivity for mouse/trackpad (default: 0)
    sensitivity = 0.35,

    touchpad = {
      -- Use natural (inverse) scrolling
      natural_scroll = true,

      -- Use two-finger clicks for right-click instead of lower-right corner
      clickfinger_behavior = true,

      -- Control the speed of your scrolling
      scroll_factor = 0.3,
    },
  },
})

-- Scroll faster in the terminal
o.window("(Alacritty|kitty|foot)", { scroll_touchpad = 1.5 })
```

### Touchpad settings

For the touchpad, you don't have to write config at all. _Setup > Config > Touchpad_ in the Omarchy menu (or `omarchy setup touchpad`) opens a settings window for natural scrolling, scroll speed, tap to click, two-finger and corner clicks, tap-and-drag, three-finger drag, pointer speed and acceleration, multi-finger gestures, per-app scroll speeds, and per-device overrides when you use more than one touchpad. Changes apply the moment you make them, and the window has a scroll list, click pad, and drag target on the side for trying them out.

The window only saves what you change, to `~/.config/omarchy/touchpad.json`, and everything else keeps following Omarchy's defaults. Pointer speed and acceleration set there apply to touchpads only, so a mouse keeps its own speed. The window is the source of truth for whatever you change in it: those settings win over the same options in `~/.config/hypr/input.lua`, and a gesture set there replaces one in `input.lua` that uses the same swipe. Options you haven't touched in the window keep whatever `input.lua` says, and the window marks the ones that file also sets; resetting one hands it back to `input.lua`.

You can [see all the input options](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Basics/Variables/#input) on the Hyprland wiki for inputs.

By default, Omarchy uses CapsLock as the compose key for [quick emojis](07-hotkeys.md#quick-emojis) and [other completions](07-hotkeys.md#quick-completions). If you'd rather use CapsLock as Caps Lock, move the compose key elsewhere by changing `compose:caps` in `kb_options`. For example, this moves the compose key to Right Alt:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    kb_options = "compose:ralt",
  },
})
```

### Trackpad gestures

The _Gestures_ page of the touchpad settings window sets these up for you. You can also turn on [touchpad gestures](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Advanced-and-Cool/Gestures/) by hand, like swiping with three fingers to change workspaces:

```lua
hl.gesture({ fingers = 3, direction = "horizontal", action = "workspace" })
```

On Dell XPS laptops with a haptic touchpad, you can also set the click strength to low, mid, or high under _Trigger > Hardware > Touchpad Haptics_.

### Typing in Chinese, Japanese, and other languages

Omarchy runs the [fcitx5](https://fcitx-im.org/) input method framework as part of every session — it's what powers the CapsLock compose sequences. That means the plumbing for non-Latin input is already in place: install an input engine like `fcitx5-mozc` (Japanese) or `fcitx5-chinese-addons` (Chinese) with `omarchy pkg add`, plus `fcitx5-configtool` to add the engine to your input methods and set the key that switches between them.

### Use ALT as SUPER

On some keyboards, it's not convenient to use the primary meta key (Windows/cmd key) as SUPER. You can change this to be ALT instead using this change:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    kb_options = "compose:caps,shift:both_capslock_cancel,altwin:swap_alt_win",
  },
})
```
